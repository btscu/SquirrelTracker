# SquirrelTracker

Group 3: Benjamin Smith & Dhruv Gondalia
UNIs: [bts2135, dag2221]

In SquirrelTracker, we track a database of over 3000 squirrel sightings in the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census.
In the project, we created features to view a list of all squirrels and their relevant characteristics, a link to view a specific squirrel from the list, a map of squirrel sightings based on longitude/latitude, and an overall statistics view. In order to do so, we implemented Python, Django and Html to build this project.

You can find the server running our application here: https://tfa-2020-spring-dag2221.wn.r.appspot.com/

We hope you enjoy our project and look forward to any feedback.
